## 🔗 Cross-Selling Product Matrix

Although the original dataset didn't include transaction-level combinations, we inferred cross-sell opportunities using product purchase volumes and logical associations:

| Product A         | Potential Cross-Sell Products         |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Laptop**        | Software Suite, Cloud Subscription     |
| **Monitor**       | Printer, Cloud Subscription            |
| **Smartphone**    | Cloud Subscription, Tablet             |
| **Tablet**        | Software Suite                         |

📌 **Recommendation**: Bundle offers and upsell strategies can be implemented based on this matrix.
